## Snyk

Murfin+ is integrated with [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) to find and patch vulnerabilities in dependencies. Here is an
example of checks on a pull request:

<a href="https://github.com/sardjv/murfin_method/pull/50"><img alt="Example of pull request check on Github showing build,
test and security review outcomed as green ticks" src={useBaseUrl('img/github_build_success.png')}/></a>

Snyk provides automated pull requests for vulnerabilities in dependencies as they arise, as well as advance patches,
developed in-house by Snyk, until the maintainers patch the root vulnerability.

## PEN Testing

A penetration test by a reputable external agency is planned before the project goes live.
